*** NOTE: This plugin has been superseded by the rabbitmq-management plugin
    and is no longer maintained. ***

This is a normal RabbitMQ plugin. For detailed installation instructions
go to:
        https://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#installing-plugins

A summary:

    hg clone https://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/
    cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
    make co
    make 
    hg clone https://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-status/
    cd rabbitmq-status
    make

After that in the directory 'rabbitmq-public-umbrella/rabbitmq-status' you 
should be able to see ready plugins:

    $ ls  dist/
    amqp_client.ez  mochiweb.ez  rabbit_common.ez  rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez
    rabbit_status.ez


To install them to a local RabbitMQ instance you need to copy some of *.ez 
files into your rabbit plugins directory and activate them, for example:

    mkdir /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-1.7.0/plugins
    cp rabbitmq-mochiweb.ez mochiweb.ez rabbit_status.ez \
        /usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-1.7.0/plugins
    rabbitmq-activate-plugins
